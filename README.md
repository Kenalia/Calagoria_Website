## Calagoria

calagor-dnd.com is a website, built with Ruby on Rails, to host information and tools that accompany my primary Dungeons and Dragons game.

The site runs on rails v5.1.4.

The site includes a Session Log page with a form page for adding new logs, as well as static pages for static information. There is also a tools section with with items such as a Calendar Transfer tool between the different calendars used within the game with their functionality written in plain javascript.
