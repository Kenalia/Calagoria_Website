    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything can be enhanced. This has become a motto of sorts for my people. &ldquo;The world is very simple, and we are very complex. We must raise the world to our standards, and raise ourselves even higher.&rdquo; This is the motto for the prestigious College of Gnomatic Advancements. As a historian, I am slightly shunned by the majority of my race. Historians do not enhance the future; we simply discover the past. I confide in you, dear reader, sometimes I wish I had never discovered our past.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our history was stolen from us by the Astics after we attempted to flee to this world. Our people held powerful positions alongside the Astics, and as painful as it is to say, we were slaughterers. We slaughtered the Elvantis, the Dwarval, even the Mortroes as strange as it may sound. We slaughtered many more; basically any one who dared defy the Astics, and dared to defy us. We created weapons that could demolish cities whole. We created devices for intentions solely of greed. Many of our creations were torturous. Dear reader, I am most ashamed to say that we carried the graphicigns of these monstrous creations onto this world, and lost them. We delivered destructive capabilities to your homes, and there is no penance fit for this transgression. Since our acceptance into the Calagorian Empire, we have focused or creations to benefit the Empire and its people. We plan to continue on this path.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we first developed the Statica Stabilizer, our leaders had discovered the signs of a plot for betrayal by the Astics. We opened the very first Astic Portal, and our leadership slipped through to this world just north of Tralin. Unfortunately, the Astic&rsquo;s understanding of the portal technology was greater than we had thought, and they were able to track us down. Forced to return, our people received a rigorous torture. Our history books were discarded, and almost all that knew the truth of our people&rsquo;s origins were slaughtered. We were discarded to this world where we finally gathered ourselves within the Empire.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally though, our race was not accepted among the Humans and our fellow Asticans. As our fellow Asticans knew of our destructive history, and we were too foreign for the Humans, we set out to establish our own lands. Heading into the frozen south, we braved the proto-storms of Eraval and established ourselves as the first inhabitants of Yatasan. Our capital, Hex-Norasan, spans the entirety of Yatasan, but claims only 0.93% of the surface area. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Humans needed to reach the skies, we developed their gliders, their wind-lifts, and have continued to upgrade their airships. As Humans reached into the seas, we developed their submersibles, and their aqua-communicators. The Natorial Frose Power Statica and Power Transport would be for naught had we not offered our knowledge of Astic Power. I present these occasions of philanthropy not to purvey our talents, but to show that we have worked hard for our position within the Empire, and we will not be removed kindly.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historians do not enhance the future, but we do discover the past. What good is genius without discovery to fuel it?</span></p>
