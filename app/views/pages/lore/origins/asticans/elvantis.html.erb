    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 3pt; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 26pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Origins of the Elvantis</span></p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 16pt; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: Arial; color: #666666; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As dictated by Forial Marin</span></p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Freedom was never our strong suit. My race, come to be known as the Elvantis, originally served in Astoris, our original plane of existence. We were enslaved by the Astics, and forced to work beneath them. Magiks, our specialty, were used to control the other races of Astoris. We fueled their war machine, and once the Astics had taken full control of our world, we fueled their prisons, and enslaved others under the Astics&rsquo; rule. We bare this shame to this day.</span></p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Fortunately for us, the Astics were hungry for more. They were never satisfied. They needed more slaves. My people were forced to develop a transfer system to a nearby plane. It was a creation our people still marvel at. Allowing travel between worlds was thought impossible. If not for the Astics, my people never would have even known of other worlds. When the Astic Rift finally opened, my people began to slip through. It was our escape.</span></p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Ever increasingly, my people escaped the Astics&rsquo; control and joined the Humans of Calagoria. King Finch, then a General, embraced us fully. King Finch accepted us into his ranks, and once crowned, gave my people land and supplies of our own. </span></p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Our new land, Storvantis, was originally a chaotic land. Reigned over by magiks released by the Astic Lash, my people were the perfect choice to undertake the ownership of the land. Our greatest architects used the feral magiks as fuel, and built our great city of Seravon. Harnessing the massive amounts of magiks left behind, we built to the very edges of our borders in only 40 years. </span></p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The believed assassination of Prokopios within our lands was a setback, and many of my people began to distrust the Humans as the Humans did us. Our army General at the time, Piskan Tranin, set up a defense line, but somehow Queen Frose navigated behind them. Thankfully, Queen Frose discovered the truth, and was able to rally the major nations to work towards the creation of the now-known Natorial Frose Power Statica and Power Transport.</span></p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Astic Bursts season was devastating for Storvantis, and we lost many great citizens. Many of our cities had to be rebuilt, but we survived. As we have since before our enslavement, we endured, and we survived.</span></p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">During the Defiling, we were forced to sever our ties with Calagoria. Their barbarism was too great for our nation to defend. &nbsp;Afterwards, our leadership repaired our alliance with Calagoria, but for many decades my people had great distrust for them.</span></p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Since The Defiler&rsquo;s fall, our alliance with Calagoria has survived, and our participation within the Gathering of Kings has never been questioned. We have developed great magiks, and assisted many nations in their own upbringings.</span></p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Elvantis have survived more than most, and shall continue to survive. No matter the cost.</span></p>
