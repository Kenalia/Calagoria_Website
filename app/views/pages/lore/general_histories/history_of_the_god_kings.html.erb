    <h1><strong>General History of the God-Kings of Calagoria</strong></h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p> Due to their overwhelming power, the first 12 kings of Calagoria were inducted into The World Above at the time of their deaths. Set to lord over the kingdom of Calagoria, these kings have taken positions as godly beings, and protect the kingdom. There are many rituals to these gods, and each has their own year within the God-Count calendar. </p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Calagor Varamus (The Creator)</strong></h2>
    <p>Born in Straight-Line -28, Calagor Varamus recognized the totalitarian dictatorship of the Before-Kingdom, and created what would later be called the Calagorian Rebels. Overthrowing the cruel rulers, Calagor was given the place as first King of Calagoria, named as such in the afterbirth of the kingdom by the first parliamentary cycle. </p>
    <p>With his death in year of Calagor, 2 (Straight-Line 25), at the age of 63, the valkyries raised his being into The World Above.</p>
    <p>Returning to his people in the year of Calagor, 3 (Straight-Line 37), Calagor explained to the 4th parliamentary cycle that he had been given an eternal rule over the land of Calagoria, as a guardian from The World Above. He would accompany the next 11 kings into similar positions in order to produce a defensive and productive guardianship council to ensure the prosperity of Calagoria.</p>
    <p>Known as The Creator, Calagor rules over the Guardian Council, and assists any being willing to fight for justice, righteousness, and the continuation of freedoms. Calagor can commonly be found on the battlefields during any confrontations Calagor faces, and in the dining hall alongside the current King of Calagoria, offering knowledge and assistance to any that desire it.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Minis Trask (The Spread)</strong></h2>
    <p> Born in Straight-Line -3, Minis Trask is the orphaned son of a Calagorian Rebels general, Trius Trask. Minis was hand-chosen by Calagor before Calagor died, and was only known due to his father&rsquo;s prowess in the Calagorian Rebellion. Minis expressed greatly through his kingship that he had never desired political advancement. Instead he had wanted to fulfill his dreams of understanding and bettering nature, as the Before-Kingdom had ruined the great forests that Calagoria sits on.</p>
    <p> Minis served his time dutifully. He dedicated many resources towards restoring the lands that support Calagoria, and with the help of Calagor, he negotiates with the surrounding lands to conglomerate into the Calagorian Empire. Each state with its own rulers, but with the powers of Calagoria behind every one of them. </p>
    <p> At the day of his death, in the year Minis, 6 (Straight-Line 74), Calagor escorted Minis into The World Above after his 77 years of life.</p>
    <p> Known as The Spread, Minis serves as the protectorate of nature within the Calagorian Empire. Minis assists any that are friends of nature, and respect the relationship between men and earth. Guiding the guilds hall of Calagoria, it is common respect to receive the blessing of Minis before creating any group of men. Minis can commonly be found in the gardens of citizens, granting assistance on any earthen knowledge they desire, and spends his leisure time grooming the renowned Garden of Calagoria.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Seris Fren (The Machine)</strong></h2>
    <p> Born in Year of Vitruvius, 3 (Straight-Line 41), Seris Fren was born to a farming family in the nation of Slovisk. At the age of 15, Seris astounded Minis Trask with her advancements in farming technology, and was employed within Calagoria&rsquo;s technological research division. Rising quickly through the ranks, Seris became the head engineer of Calagoria&rsquo;s technological research division. As head engineer, Seris lead mass advancements throughout the Calagorian Empire.</p>
    <p> Minis Trask chose Seris to surpass him, and at the age of 33 Seris began restructuring the Calagorian Empire. By collectivising the Empire, she seeked to allow for Empire citizens from nations outside of Calagoria to have an equal opportunity to succeed as Calagorians do.</p>
    <p> The latter half of Seris&rsquo; reign was spent developing a school system throughout the Calagorian Empire. The school system was developed rapidly, and is considered by historians as one of the greatest creations by any of the 12 God-Kings.</p>
    <p> Seris died early and suddenly at the age of 46 in the year of Seris, 7 ( Straight-Line 87), when she drowned attempting to test the first iteration of the aqueducts system that still provides water to Calagorians today. Calagor escorted Seris to The World Above, where it is said Seris spent 10 years studying the inventions of the gods, before finally returning to Calagoria.</p>
    <p> Known simply as The Machine, Serif continues to develop the technological state of the Calagorian Empire through engaging the minds of engineers throughout the land. Serif can commonly be found in workshops throughout the Calagorian Empire, and in her birth land of Slovisk, where she teaches classes at an engineering school named after her.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Daris Fren (The Smith)</strong></h2>
    <p> Born in the year of Mstislav, 5 (Straight-Line 72), Daris, the son of Seris, was the first King chosen by parliament. With Seris&rsquo; untimely death, there was no true passage of Kingship. Daris was criticized harshly for this. Seen as a usurper, and an illegitimate ruler, 15-year-old Daris spent most of his Kingship in solitude.</p>
    <p> Choosing to order vassals rather than appear himself, the enemies of Calagoria saw Daris as weak. His young age and solitary nature had already lost him the belief of the people, and seemed to have bolstered his enemies&rsquo; arrogance.</p>
    <p>In the year of Hagen, 8 (Straight-Line 107), an unnamed force marched into Calagoria. This force slaughtered over 15,000 citizens before it met any resistance. In the town of Sarkin, where this battle is since named after, a force of Calagorian Knights marched in to face the invaders. Rather than wearing the required Royal Calagorian Laminar, these knights rode forth wearing an armor that looked more suitable for a royal party than for a battle. Lead by a large man in the same armor type, but ornate red rather than the Calagorian blue and orange. Underestimated by the enemy, this small force of 500 cut through the majority of the invading 35,000, leaving the rest to retreat in fear. </p>
    <p>Revealed to the public 3 Straight-Line later in Straight-Line 110, this force was wearing a special new armor design by Daris himself, with Daris leading the force. </p>
    <p>His &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Brigandine&rdquo; armor design is still considered the greatest of man&rsquo;s armors, and is recreated in the form of every new king since.</p>
    <p>Daris returned to his life of solitude, but his creations were much more of a public spectacle after these events. He developed many smithworks to assist the people of Calagoria in both war and peace.</p>
    <p>With his death in the year of Ritsa, 12 (Straight-Line 152), Daris&rsquo; funeral had the smallest reception, and Daris was carried by Calagor to The World Above.</p>
    <p>Daris, known as The Smith, is rarely seen in Calagoria. It is said he crafts smithworks for the gods, and prefers to wisp new designs into the hands of Calagoria&rsquo;s greatest smiths. </p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Vitruvius Aryn (The Beautiful)</strong></h2>
    <p>Born in the year of Helena, 10 (Straight-Line 130), Vitruvius Aryn was known as the most beautiful man in all of Calagoria. Known for his charisma, Vitruvius was called to a meeting with Daris Fren in year of Adrianus, 12 (Straight-Line 150). Daris knew that the citizens of Calagoria needed a King they could relate with, and the contrast between the two men was stark. Daris was truly surprised when he found that Vitruvius was incredibly humble. Treating his beauty as a tool rather than a gift, Vitruvius wanted to be known for more than how people saw him. It is said that Daris chose Vitruvius to surpass him within this meeting alone, even though they met four times after that.</p>
    <p> Vitruvius denied the generous battle-training all kings were offered. He preferred diplomacy. Wielding his charisma and beauty as though they were sword and shield, Vitruvius cut through leaders abundant with his words. With the ability to persuade you to his side, and against another, Vitruvius was truly a political mastermind.</p>
    <p> Vitruvius negotiated trade deals, established greater relationships, and expanded the Calagorian Empire to more than double its size. Unfortunately, as denoted by his God-King name, The Beautiful, Vitruvius was always revered most for his beauty. His biography, <em>The Beauty of an Empire</em>, is renowned by poets and novelists alike for Vitruvius&rsquo; ability to portray himself as a simple man that used the best of a bad situation.</p>
    <p>Vitruvius&rsquo; death in the year of Vitruvius, 18 (Straight-Line 221), placed the Empire in a state of unrest. It is said every nation within the Empire held a funeral for him, and all conflict stopped to mourn his passing.</p>
    <p>Vitruvius can commonly be seen assisting caretakers within the orphanages of the Calagorian Empire, and assisting Calagorians in their production of words, no matter the motive.</p>
    <p>Vitruvius denied the 13th parliament&rsquo;s request to choose an heir.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Adrianus Wrynn (The Dragon)</strong></h2>
    <p>Born in the year of Daris, 15 (Straight-Line 184), Adrianus Wrynn was abandoned by his parents, and was raised within the orphanages of Tralin, one of the outer nations added to the Calagorian Empire during Vitruvius&rsquo; reign. Adrianus adored Vitruvius, but the foster home Adrianus was placed in scorned Adrianus&rsquo; mind towards Vitruvius. He developed a hatred for the King, as he felt that if Vitruvius truly loved his citizens, he would liberate Adrianus from his torture.</p>
    <p> At the time of Vitruvius&rsquo; passing, Adrianus was a soldier in the Tralin 15th Cavalry. He immediately abandoned his post, and is said to have rode nonstop to the Throne, where he demanded he meet with parliament.</p>
    <p> Parliament had been attempting to find a worthy successor with a more militaristic focus. They feared that the expanded area of the Calagorian Empire was uncontrollable. Adrianus, having served in the Tralin military for over 20 years, and being from an outskirts nation, was the obvious choice.</p>
    <p> Adrianus, within days of his crowning ceremony, ordered for a large military force to be assembled in Tralin. Numbering 50,000 soldiers from all over the Calagorian Empire, this force moved into the friendly territories to the East. Slaughtering civilians and military alike, until the force, now 80,000 strong, had eradicated the nation, and secured its borders all the way to the Eastern Sea. Adrianus divided this new land into thirds. 1/3rd going to Calagoria itself, now known as East Caliphin, 1/3rd going to the nation of Voracia for their large supply of troops, and the largest 1/3rd going to the nation of Tralin.</p>
    <p> Adrianus relocated the Capital of Caligoria into this new territory, and from this position lead many more military outreaches into both the lands across the Eastern Sea, and into other nations surrounding the Caligorian Empire, both friend and enemy alike.</p>
    <p> Adrianus, at the age of 54, in the year of Helena, 19 (Straight-Line 238), Adrianus took his own life upon the throne. To this day, royal historians can not discern why. At the height of his power, he gave it all up.</p>
    <p> Though not particularly liked by many citizens of Caligoria, Adrianus was still carried to the World Above, and granted his place as a God-King, as The Dragon. Though Adrianus has not been seen since, Calagor assures parliament that he does walk among men, and fulfills his duties as a God-King.</p>
    <p> Many of the lands Adrianus captured were returned to their natural inhabitants.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Pavlos Sinc (The Individualist)</strong></h2>
    <p>His birth-date and place known only to the Royal Historical Society, Pavlos Sinc was chosen by the 20th parliament to replace Adrianus Wrynn. Filling Calagoria&rsquo;s 5 year vacancy, Pavlos was instantly liked by all Calagorians. He saw each single citizen for what they could be, and promoted self-improvement above all else. </p>
    <p>Pavlos was not known for his glory in battle, as he preferred to allow his generals to lead without oversight. Not flaunted for his speeches, as he rarely appeared before the masses. His literacy was commonly questioned, as he was never known to read in public. Pavlos was simply known for his one-on-one talks with citizens on his daily walks the Capital.</p>
    <p>Pavlos was disliked by the Calagorian Empire, as he seemed to refuse to leave Calagoria. Pavlos did not receive a public funeral, and his death was finally announced to the public in the year of Helena, 23 (Straight-Line 286), almost 2 years after his last public appearance.</p>
    <p>Pavlos can be seen walking the streets of Calagoria, stopping often to speak passing comments to citizens. Pavlos is known as The Individualist to Caligorians, but is known as The Distant to the rest of the Caligorian Empire.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Ritsa Malin (The Defender)</strong></h2>
    <p> Born in the year of Mstislav, 21 (Straight-Line 264), Ritsa Malin is a native to East Caliphin. Born under a lineage of East Caliphin natives dating back to Straight-Line -381, Ritsa was a member of the Vistran Resistance; the group is named after the last ruler of the Eastern Lands. Though the Vistran Resistance sought the downfall of Calagoria, it was Ritsa, on a reconnaissance mission in the city of Torus, that leapt to the defense of the city when it was assaulted by earthen creatures. Expertly dispatching of the creatures, and rallying the town to defense, Ritsa became a legend to Calagorians. As the First Astic War began, Ritsa left the resistance and joined the Calagorian military. Rising quickly through the ranks, Ritsa caught parliament&rsquo;s eye. </p>
    <p>Officially crowned king in the year of Mstislav, 23 (Straight-Line 288), Ritsa began to rally the Calagorian Empire, and the Third Astic War looked as though they could turn in the Calagorian favor. </p>
    <p>In the year of Adrianus, 26 (Straight-Line 318), as victory seemed in sight, the Astic rift opened once again, and out spewed mystic forces more powerful than anything the Calagoria had ever dreamed of. Ritsa fought valiantly, standing against the hordes&rsquo; most dangerous creatures. After 2 days of constant fighting, Ritsa was slain. His body was never recovered. </p>
    <p>Ritsa&rsquo;s death rallied the Empire into defense, and Ritsa is credited as the primary member in finally ending the Astic wars. </p>
    <p>Ritsa is known as The Defender, and his contributions to Calagorian moral still ring through today. Ritsa can be found wherever Calagorians require defense, and reclaiming alliance between the raging forces of East Calaphin.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Prokopios Finch (The Leader)</strong></h2>
    <p> The most trusted of Ritsa&rsquo;s generals, Prokopios was the obvious choice for kingship after Ritsa&rsquo;s fall. Crowned in the second month after Ritsa&rsquo;s death, Prokopios reformed the structure of Calagoria&rsquo;s military. Prokopios introduced never-before-seen battle strategies. Prokopios gained his true fame from his strategic intervention during the Astic Lash.</p>
    <p> Being the frontal force for military missions, land explorations, East Sea voyages, and magikries testing, Prokopios seemed to always lead the Calagorian Empire into any endeavour it must embark.</p>
    <p> Prokopios was very interested in the magikries that began to spawn after the Astic Wars, and he himself learned how to harness it. He kept detailed journals of his magikries testings, and of all other studies in his continuance.</p>
    <p> Perhaps Prokopios&rsquo; most famed action was his first contact events with the Elvantis and the Dwarval. Prokopios famously said, &ldquo;The appearance of change changes you. The change is not affected by itself, and its own appearance will not block its way forward. You must do as the change does, and continue.&rdquo;</p>
    <p> Prokopios was assassinated during an experiment in the year of Mstislav, 30 (Straight-Line 372). His experiment was taking place in Elvantis territory, and the Elvantis leadership had assured Calagoria that Prokopios would be protected. With their inability to provide an explanation for Prokopios&rsquo; death, the Calagorian Empire turned on the Elvantis.</p>
    <p> Prokopios is known as the Leader, and can still be found assisting those that would embark on new endeavours. Prokopios is commonly spotted by sailors and scientists alike, and to all races. Prokopios has never been spotted in Elvantis land.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Helena Frose (The Guide)</strong></h2>
    <p> Helena Frose, a Dwarval of her 20th year, had become Prokopios Finch&rsquo;s research assistant and dear friend in Prokopios&rsquo; later years. Choosing not to accompany Prokopios into Elvantis territory, Helena was spared during Prokopios&rsquo; assassination. Prokopios had left explicit instructions to parliament months before his death, that if he was to meet his departure, Helena will surpass him. Parliament abided by Prokopios&rsquo; wishes, and Helena Frose was crowned in the year of Calagor, 31 (Straight-Line 373), the first non-Human to hold the position.</p>
    <p> Helena faced heavy opposition from the citizens of Calagoria. Prokopios had trusted her, and so the people had as well, but rumors began to spread quickly after Prokopios&rsquo; death, insinuating that Helena had been involved in Prokopios&rsquo; assassination.</p>
    <p> Helena ignored the rumors, and delved into discovering the truth behind Prokopios&rsquo; death. Helena needed access to Prokopios&rsquo; experiment site, so she marched a cardinal force to the site, without encountering any Elvantis. Her people were amazed at Helena&rsquo;s ability to avoid confrontation.</p>
    <p> At the site of Prokopios&rsquo; assassination, Helena found that there had been no assassination at all. The site was new as the day it was formed. Prokopios had embarked on this experiment because the Elvantis had worries about a large crater that had appeared at the location. Helena found no crater, no Calagorian research settlement, no bodies. Helena found nothing. After determining that this was the location Prokopios set out for, Helena returned to Calagoria. Helena quelmed the outrage towards the Elvanist within her famous, &ldquo;Those That May Decide,&rdquo; speech, and began formulating from the new information she had gathered at Prokopios&rsquo; Experiment site.</p>
    <p> Helena discovered that the magikries that the Astic released were corrupting portions of the earth, and that at every power build-up, the power was released, in some form of magiks effect, upon the earth. If the unstable power build-up was not contained, events such as the Prokopian Burst would continue to ravage upon her citizens, and all persons, Calagorian or otherwise.</p>
    <p> Helena sought the assistance of Saris Fren and Vitruvius Aryn, for she needed a way to harness this unstable power, and she needed all nations assistance for it to be completed. Granting their assistance, Saris Fren began crafting designs for power storage systems, and Vitruvius began meeting with nations outside of the Calagorian Empire to convince them to work alongside Calagoria. Deals were made, teams were created, and through many catastrophic Bursts, Helena guided the very fragile alliances through it all.</p>
    <p> In the year of Prokopios, 33 (Straight-Line 405), the Natorial Frose Power Statica was finished, and the Natorial Frose Power Transport had its first connection established. The Power Statica would store the build-up, and the Power Transport would provide Natorials with a fast, efficient transport system, while also preventing overcharge of Astic Power.</p>
    <p> Helena Frose died in the year of Seris, 38 (Straight-Line 459), at the age of 106. Helena, The Guide, can be found wherever the way forward is unclear. Those who feel lost will fight through with her assistance, and those who are lost will find light in her guidance.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Hagen Moore (The Wind)</strong></h2>
    <p>Hagen Moore was the head of parliament at the time of Helena Frose&rsquo;s death. Helena felt no need to elect an heir, and so after Helena&rsquo;s passing, Hagen was crowned.</p>
    <p>With the Calagorian Empire at peace, Hagen simply kept it that way. Historians detail his life as, &ldquo;a passing moment,&rdquo; such as the wind.</p>
    <p>Hagen was proficient in many areas of study, and assists students and masters alike in their quests for knowledge.</p>
    <p>Hagen died naturally in the year of Prokopios, 42 (Straight-Line 513), but many believe his weak health was due to the creeping evil within the Empire.</p>
    <h2><strong> </strong><strong>Mstislav (The Defiler)</strong></h2>
    <p> As though simply to disrupt the peace of the world, a wave of influence ran through Calagoria. Estimated to have begun in the year of Calagor, 42 (Straight-Line 505), the citizens of the Calagorian Empire began to form what could only be described as a rebellion. In a time of peace, where only prosperity had befallen the Empire, there was no clear reasoning for these actions. </p>
    <p>As rage and corruption spread across the Empire, acts of chaos and evil began to rise in occurrence. Jarls slaughtering their citizens; treasurers fleeing into the night as the bank is found empty; parents butchering their children as they sleep, before taking their own lives. The Empire was overcome with evil.</p>
    <p>In the year of Hagen, 42 (Straight-Line 515), parliament elected not a man, but a creature of pure evil, into kingship. The creature, calling itself Mstislav, took advantage of the evil, and began to tear down everything Calagoria had become. Alliances were broken as cardinal forces marched into allied lands and slaughtered their citizens. Many attacks were made through the Natorial Frose Power Transport connections Calagoria had with its allies, but these were quickly deactivated by those attacked, and those in fear for their futures. </p>
    <p>With no outlet for its power, the Natorial Frose Power Statica was forced to deny storage of Astic Power, and the Power Bursts began to ravage the land once again.</p>
    <p>In the year of Minis, 44 (Straight-Line 530), an event, now known as the Statica Burst, occurred within the Capital of Calagoria. The Natorial Frose Power Statica was overloaded, presumably by Mstislav himself, and with its overload, the Statica destroyed the surrounding 40 miles of civilization. </p>
    <p>At the land&rsquo;s darkest hour, 8 of the God-Kings descended upon Mstislav at the alternate Capital within East Calaphin. Their might combined, Mstislav was finally slain after 5 days of constant battle. </p>
    <p>The God-Kings restored the Power Statica, and as evil began to fade from the land, the God-Kings assisted in restoring alliances, and rebuilding after the destruction.</p>
    <p>Mstislav, known as The Defiler, was given his position as God-King, as Calagor had promised the land he, and the other 11 God-Kings, would at the time of their death. Mstislav was originally kept contained in The World Above, but was somehow allowed to escape into the Mortal-Realm. Any exorbitant use of his power will reveal him to the other God-Kings, so Mstislav is rarely seen, and his powers are used only to the extent of simple tricks and small plots.</p>
    <p>Mstislav is still incredibly dangerous to mortals.</p>
