        <h2><strong>Snow Day</strong></h2>
        <p>
        You awaken in the night. Your fire crackles, and your wolf rustles in place. You have not been asleep long. You had found refuge from the dense snow within this mountain-side, but the storm seems to have barricaded your exit. For five days you attempt to free yourself, but the raging winter never ceases. You run out of food, are forced to eat your wolf, and by the time the snow finally clears from your exit, you are too weak to escape. You starve.

        <h2><strong>Struck Down</strong></h2>
        <p>The battle rages on. Your comrades fall left and right, but you push on. Lightning surges from above, and you feel your body halt. The noise disappears, your eyesight begins to fade. You spot the magiks user that ended your crusade, and he laughs as your corpse falls to the ground.</p>

    <h2><strong>Haggling</strong></h2>
    <p>You had never expected this would be the way you go out. You don’t even know how you got here. All you remember is a bar, feelings of lust, and the free whiskey. Now you’re strapped to a wooden post; surrounded crazy hags in loincloths. They dance around you. Their screeching floods your mind with pain, and the fire at your feets dulls your nerves. The screeching is too much, and you scream out in pain as your skin succumbs to the fire.</p>

        <h2><strong>Softly Into That Dark Night</strong></h2>
        <p>You slowly drift off to sleep. You don't wake up.</p>

    <h2><strong>Pillow Talk</strong></h2>
    <p>She’s perfect. She’s everything you’ve ever wanted. Who cares what people think. Sure, you might have just met her tonight, but who cares, right? All that matters is you love each other, not whether you met in a bar at 2am or not. Who do they think they are criticizing the way you are. You push those thoughts out of your head. She whispers something about food, and you are a little peckish, so why not? She gets out of bed, and tells you to stay put. Does she even know where the kitchen is? You lay your head back down, and begin to fall asleep. The light encroaches into your room; awaking you from your slumber. Your vision is hazy, and a figure approaches from the light. Your beautiful darling. How wonderful your future together will be. Your vision fades, and you fall into slumber once more. You awaken slightly as you choke on your own blood.</p>

        <h2><strong>Spoiler Alert</strong></h2>
        <p>You’ve killed a lot of men in your time. Battle-hardened warriors, scared teenagers, privates, and generals. You’ve killed more men than you can count. You never thought those you killed would end up killing you.</p>
